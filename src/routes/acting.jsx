        Basically, I include a summary of myself as an actor. Then link my
        resume. Then maybe a complete list of acting roles? TBD. Then some
        pictures, then possibly some videos, with descriptions.

        Or maybe there are links to photos of my performances first, so I have
        individual pages which act as photo albums for each play or production
        that I have photos for. Or I have some selected ones in the main acting
        page. Maybe with links to the ones that I have more photos for, like
        baron's men plays, etc.
