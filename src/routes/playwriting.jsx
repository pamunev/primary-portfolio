        Here will go some description of me as a playwright. Maybe some notable
        accomplishments. Some photos maybe. Links to my plays, or downloadable
        versions? Or just a link to my new play exchange? I want to look at the
        writing portfolio of Laura Neill and maybe some other playwrights.
